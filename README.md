## ASP Server CGI


</div>

### Description

I am working on an Open Source Web Server (http://www.html-helper.com/powerserver/) written in Delphi and Visual Basic that supports PHP, Perl and ASP. This is the ASP CGI that turns ASP scripts into the actual page that is being sent to the client.

I admit this is a little difficult step into without knowing the "in's and out's" of the server itself.

I submited this because I see alot of people attempting to make ASP servers.

Basically this is called by the server and formats the ASP script into a web page.

I did not submit a image with this because as you can see the GUI is nothing fancy.

Just Load the Program and click the "Go" button - then examine the code.
 
### More Info
 
Creates ASP pages from ASP scripts

Some knowlege of ASP and the MS Script control

Probably a few hundred bugs
